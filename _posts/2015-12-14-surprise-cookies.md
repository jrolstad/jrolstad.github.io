### Ingredients
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup cocoa powder - not ducth
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup  whole milk
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 15 large marshmallows, cut in half horizontally

- Frosting

- 3 cups confectioners' sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/4 cup plus 1 /2/ teaspoons cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup plus 2 Tablespoons whole milk
- 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

- Directions

- Place confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl. Melt butter with 
- cocoa powder in sauce pan over medium heat stirring occasionally. 
- Add butter mixture to the confectioners' sugar.  Whisk in milk and vanilla.


### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg, milk, and vanilla, and beat until well combined. Add reserved flour mixture 1/2 cup at a time; mix on low speed until combined.
3. Using a tablespoon or 1 3/4-inch ice cream scoop, drop dough onto ungreased baking sheets lined with parchment, about 2 inches apart. Bake until cookies and rotate halfway until firm and begin to spread and become firm, 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Remove baking sheets from oven, and place a marshmallow, cut-side down, in the center of each cookie, pressing down slightly. Return to oven, and continue baking until marshmallows begin to melt, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.
5. Spread about 1 tablespoon of frosting over each marshmallow, starting in the center and continuing outward until marshmallow is covered. Let stand about ten minutes.
6. Cook's Note
7. Putting two sheets in the oven at a time? Since hot air rises, switch top and bottom sheets halfway through for more even baking.
