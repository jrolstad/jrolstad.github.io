### Servings
2 slabs

### Ingredients
- Ingredients
- 2 whole slabs pork baby back ribs
- Dry Rub:
- 8 tablespoons light brown sugar, tightly packed
- 3 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon jalapeno seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon rubbed thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

- Braising Liquid:
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped



### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 225 degrees.
2. In a bowl, combine all dry ingredients and mix well.
3. Place each slab of baby back ribs on a piece of
4. heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny side down.
5. Sprinkle each side generously with the dry rub.
6. Pat the dry rub into the meat. Refrigerate the
7. ribs for a minimum of 1 hour. In a microwavable
8. container, combine all ingredients for the braising
9. liquid. Microwave on high for 1 minute.
10. Place the ribs on a baking sheet. Open one
11. end of the foil on each slab and pour half of the
12. braising liquid into each foil packet. Tilt the baking
13. sheet in order to equally distribute the braising
14. liquid. Braise the ribs in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.
15. Transfer the braising liquid into a medium saucepot.
16. Bring the liquid to a simmer and reduce by half or
17. until of a thick syrup consistency. Brush the glaze
18. onto the ribs. Place under the broiler just until the
19. glaze caramelizes lightly. Slice each slab into 2 rib
20. bone portions. Place the remaining hot glaze into a
21. bowl and toss the rib portions in the glaze.
22. *This recipe makes several batches of dry rub.
23. If more rub is needed, it can be extended by any
24. amount, as long as the ratio of 8:3:1:1 remains the same.
