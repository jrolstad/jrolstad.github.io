### Servings
4

### Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 New York strip steaks (10 to 11 ounces each; about 1 inch thick), fat trimmed, patted dry (Emeril's Red Marble Steaks)
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 3/4 cup full-bodied red wine, such as Syrah or Cabernet Sauvignon
- 1/2 cup beef stock
- 3 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard




### Directions
1. Heat half the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season 2 steaks with 3/4 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Cook until deep golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 130 degrees, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter, and tent with foil. Repeat with remaining oil and steaks. Let steaks rest in a 250 degree oven.
2. Reduce heat to medium, and add wine to skillet. Cook until almost completely reduced, about 5 minutes. Add beef stock, and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 2 1/2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and whisk in butter (1 piece at a time) and mustard. Stir in any juices from the platter, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over steaks.
