### Servings
5

### Ingredients
- 2 avocados (remove pit and skin)
- 3/4 cup + 1 Tablespoon of Cocoa Powder 
- (Hershey's special dark is my favorite!)
- 1/3 cup milk (dairy or nondairy) *I used almond.
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup agave

### Directions
1. Combine all ingredients in food processor until smooth.
2. Use a piping bag to get filling into the molds
3. (to avoid a mess). Tap the containers so that the air bubbles pop.
4. Stick in the freezer overnight, or until they freeze.
5. (I like to freeze mine for like 36 hrs before eating)
6. If your fudgsicles are hard to remove from their
7. containers- run the popsicle mold under hot water
8. briefly and the fudgesicles will come loose.
9. Notes:
10. This recipe made 5 fudgsicles for me.. the number you
11. get will depend on the size of your popsicle mold.
12. I added chocolate chips for fun- they are not needed,
13. but add a fun texture. I used dairy free chocolate chips.
14. You may be able to get away with using honey or coconut
15. palm nectar. I used agave due to the fact that it does not
16. have a strong flavor. I saw "blonde" coconut nectar in stores
17. the other day..I have not tried it yet, but think it may work
18. well in this recipe. If you use honey you may need less than
19. the 1/4 cup that I have called for.
20. Having been sugar free for over a year. I have come to love
21. dark chocolate not too sweet. Therefore you may find these
22. pops are more rich than super sweet. Taste the chocolate
23. mousse before you put it in the molds and feel free to add a
24. little additional agave if you want.
25. While I have not tried to make these sugar free, I suspect
26. that the sugar might be needed. Without sugar- popsicles
27. and ice cream typically become icy hard.
