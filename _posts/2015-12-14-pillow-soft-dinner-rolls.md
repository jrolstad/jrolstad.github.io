### Servings
24

### Ingredients
-     4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
-     1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
-     2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
-     6 tablespoons shortening
-     2 eggs
-     1/4 cup sugar
-     1 1/2 teaspoons salt
-     7 cups all-purpose flour


### Directions
1. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, shortening, eggs, sugar, salt and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
2. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes (dough will be sticky). Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
3. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 24 pieces. Shape each into a roll. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks.
