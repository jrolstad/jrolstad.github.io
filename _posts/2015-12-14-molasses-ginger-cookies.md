- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 freshly ground white pepper

1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Into a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and salt.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, brown sugar, and molasses until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until smooth. Add flour mixture; beat until combined.Wrap dough in plastic, flattened into a disk. Chill until firm, about 1 hour or overnight.

4. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until firm around the edges and slightly soft in the center, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container up to 3 days.
