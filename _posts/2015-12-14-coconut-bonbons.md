### Ingredients
- 12 chocolate wafer cookies
- 1/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
- 2 pints coconut sorbet
- 12 whole almonds
- 26 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening

### Directions
1. Set a wire rack over a baking pan. Arrange the wafers, top sides down, on rack, spaced evenly apart. Place 2 teaspoons shredded coconut in the center of each wafer. Using a 2-inch ice-cream scoop, scoop a ball of coconut sorbet onto each wafer. Place an almond on top of each scoop of sorbet. Transfer pan to freezer for 20 minutes.
2. In a double boiler, or a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Melt chocolate and shortening, stirring occasionally. Remove bowl from heat. Let cool slightly.
3. Remove baking pan from freezer. Generously ladle melted chocolate over the bonbons, covering entirely. Return the baking pan to the freezer for 30 minutes more or overnight. Serve.
