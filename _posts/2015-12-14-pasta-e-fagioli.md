### Ingredients
-     1 tablespoon olive oil
-     2 ounces prosciutto or turkey bacon, chopped
-     2 cups chopped onions (2 large)
-     1/2 cup chopped celery (1 stalk)
-     1/2 cup chopped carrot (1 medium)
-     2 tablespoons bottled minced garlic
-     1 tablespoon dried oregano, crushed
-     1 teaspoon anchovy paste (optional)
-     1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
-     2 14 ounce can reduced-sodium chicken broth
-     1 28 ounce can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained
-     1 cup whole grain medium pasta shells
-     2 15 ounce can no-salt-added cannellini beans (white kidney beans), rinsed and drained
-     1/2 cup snipped fresh parsley
-     2 tablespoons lemon juice
-     1/4 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese (1 ounce)


### Directions
1. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add prosciutto; cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer prosciutto to paper towels; let drain. Set aside.
2. Add onions, celery, carrot, and garlic to the Dutch oven; cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until softened, stirring frequently. Stir in oregano, anchovy paste (if desired), and crushed red pepper. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add broth, tomatoes, and pasta shells. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, about 15 minutes or until pasta is tender.
3. Meanwhile, use a fork to mash one can of the beans. Stir the whole and mashed beans into pasta mixture. Simmer about 5 minutes or until heated through.
4. Stir in parsley and lemon juice. Immediately ladle into serving bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan and the prosciutto. Makes 8 servings (1 cup each)
