### Servings


### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
- 8 ears fresh corn, husks and silk removed, kernels cut from cobs
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper




### Directions
1. Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add jalapeno, and cook 1 minute. Add corn; cook, stirring, until kernels are tender but not browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
2. Transfer 1 1/2 cups cooked corn to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, and add cream and milk. Process until mixture is very smooth, about 3 minutes. Pass mixture through a fine sieve into a medium bowl, pressing down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
3. Return strained liquid to saute pan, and stir to combine with remaining corn mixture. Cook over medium heat until liquid just comes to a simmer. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
