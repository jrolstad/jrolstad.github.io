### Servings
12

### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 cup (2 sticks) plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup packed light-brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsulfured molasses
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup sanding or granulated sugar




### Directions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, allspice, and white pepper; set aside.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine butter with light-brown and granulated sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in molasses and egg; mix well. Add the reserved dry ingredients, and beat until just combined. Form dough into a ball, and cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight.
3. Remove dough from refrigerator. Using an ice-cream scoop, shape dough into 2-inch-diameter balls. Pour sanding sugar into a large bowl, and roll balls in sanding sugar, coating well. Place cookies on prepared baking sheets, spaced 4 inches apart; flatten each into a 3-inch-diameter disk.
4. Transfer to oven, and bake until brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container up to 2 days.
