### Servings
4 cups

### Ingredients
- 4 large egg whites
- 1 cup superfine sugar
- Pinch cream of tartar
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

### Directions
1. Fill a medium saucepan one-quarter full with water. Set over medium heat; bring water to a simmer.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar; place over saucepan. Whisk constantly until sugar is dissolved and whites are warm to the touch, about 3 minutes. Rub mixture between fingers to test.
3. Transfer bowl to mixer stand, and whip, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to high, until meringue is cool and stiff, glossy peaks form, about 10 minutes. Add vanilla; mix until combined. Use immediately.
