### Servings

### Ingredients
- BREADING AND FRYING
- 2 cups fine plain fresh breadcrumbs (see tip below)
- 1/2 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese (1 ounce)
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 pound chicken cutlets, or veal cutlets pounded to an 1/8-inch thickness
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more if needed

- ASSEMBLING
- Marinara Sauce
- 1 1/4 cups coarsely grated mozzarella cheese (5 ounces)
- 1/4 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese (1/2 ounce)




### Directions
1. Bread and fry the cutlets: Combine breadcrumbs, pecorino Romano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and some pepper. Put flour, eggs, and breadcrumb mixture in 3 separate dishes. Dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg, letting excess drip off. Dredge in breadcrumbs to coat. Let stand for 30 minutes.
2. Heat oil in large straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat. (Oil is ready when a breadcrumb sizzles when dropped in.) Working in batches, fry cutlets until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. (If oil gets too dirty, discard, and heat an additional 1/4 cup.)
3. Assemble the dish: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spread 3/4 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange a single layer of cutlets on top. Top with 1 cup sauce, covering each piece. Sprinkle with mozzarella and pecorino Romano. Cover with foil. Bake until bubbling, about 10 minutes. Uncover; bake until cheese melts, about 2 minutes more.
4. Helpful Hint
5. Making breadcrumbs is easy and inexpensive. Grate day-old bread against the large holes of a box grater, chop it with a bread knife, or pulse pieces in a food processor. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
