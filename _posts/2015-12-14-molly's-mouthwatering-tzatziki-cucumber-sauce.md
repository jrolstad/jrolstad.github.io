### Servings
22

### Ingredients
- 1 large cucumber, peeled and cut into chunks
- 1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- salt and pepper to taste

### Directions
1. Chop the cucumber in a food processor until nearly liquefied; strain through a piece of cheesecloth to remove excess moisture, being careful to not over-drain and lose too much of the fresh flavor.
2. Mix the cucumber, yogurt, garlic, sour cream, and mayonnaise together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.
