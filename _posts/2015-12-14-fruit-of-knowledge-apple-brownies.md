### Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

- 2 large firm-sweet apples (about 1 pound total), peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (2 3/4 cups)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees with rack in center position. Generously butter an 8-by-11-inch baking dish.
