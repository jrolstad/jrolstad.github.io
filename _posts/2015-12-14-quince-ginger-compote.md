### Servings
7 Cups

### Ingredients
- 3 cups off-dry white wine, such as Riesling
- 1 1/2 cups water, plus more if needed
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 12 thin slices peeled fresh ginger (from one 2-inch piece)
- 3 pounds just ripened quince (about 4), peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch wedges (melissas.com)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice



### Directions
1. Bring wine, water, sugar, and ginger to a simmer in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Add quinces. (Add more water if needed to cover fruit.) Reduce heat, and simmer gently until quinces are tender, 25 to 45 minutes depending on ripeness of fruit.
2. Transfer quinces to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Bring liquid in saucepan to a simmer, and cook until slightly syrupy, about 5 minutes. Remove, and discard ginger. Stir in lemon juice. Pour syrup over quinces. Let stand until cool. Refrigerate if desired.
3. Helpful Hint
4. Storage: Compote can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.
