### Servings
50

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups slivered almonds (optional)
- 1 pound best-quality bittersweet chocolate
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

### Directions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Place almonds, if using, on a baking sheet, and toast until fragrant, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Use a serrated knife to finely chop chocolate. Place in a heat-proof bowl; set aside.
2. In a small saucepan, bring cream to a boil. Pour directly over chopped chocolate, stirring to fully incorporate. Let sit for 10 minutes. Stir until completely smooth. Allow to cool for 20 minutes.
3. Stir in almonds, if using, and place in the refrigerator until set. Use a melon baller or 1 1/4-inch ice cream scoop to portion out chocolate. Roll the mixture between palms to form 1-inch truffles. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Coat with confectioners' sugar before serving.
