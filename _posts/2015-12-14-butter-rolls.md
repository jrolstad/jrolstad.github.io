### Ingredients
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
- ¼ cup sugar
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- 2 eggs, divided
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup butter or margarine, softened
- 1 Tablespoon water
- Sesame or poppy seeds

### Directions
1. Stir together yeast and ¼ cup water in a measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes.
2. Pulse 1 cup flour, sugar and salt in a food processor until blended.  Add yeast mixture, 1 egg, and milk; pulse until blended.
3. (Pulsing prevents mixture from overheating, which would kill yeast.)  Add butter, 1 Tablespoon at a time, pulsing until combined.
4. Gradually add enough of remaining flour until dough is not longer sticky.  (Dough should be smooth.)
5. Place dough in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top.
6. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.  Punch dough down and divide into fourths; shape each portion into 6 (1 inch) balls.  Place in a lightly greased 13x9 inch pan.
7. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour.
8. Stir together remaining egg and 1 Tablespoon water; brush over rolls, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
9. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.  Freeze up to 3 months if desired.
