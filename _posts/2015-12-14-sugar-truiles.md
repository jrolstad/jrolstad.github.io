### Servings
30

### Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, sifted


### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Melt butter, sugar, and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbling. Remove from heat, and whisk in flour.
2. Spread half the batter on a nonstick-baking-mat-lined baking sheet to create a thin layer (but not so thin that you can see the baking mat). Bake until dark amber, about 9 1/2 minutes.
3. Remove from oven; carefully remove baking mat from sheet, and transfer tuile to a cool surface to harden. Let cool for 1 minute. Cut out tuiles using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, and transfer to a cool surface to harden. If tuile gets too hard before cutting, return to oven for about 30 seconds to soften, then continue cutting.
4. Repeat with remaining batter.
