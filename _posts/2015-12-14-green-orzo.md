### Ingredients
- Salt
- 1 1/4 cups orzo
- 2 bunches arugula (about 1 pound)
- 1 clove garlic
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste


### Directions
1. Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil. Stir in orzo. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes, or follow package instructions. Drain in a colander, and set aside.
2. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath. Blanch arugula in boiling water until bright green in color, 5 to 10 seconds. Immediately transfer arugula to ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain, and squeeze out any excess water.
3. Place arugula and garlic in the bowl of a food processor. Using the feed tube, slowly add olive oil while pulsing machine on and off. Add 1 teaspoon salt and pepper; process until pureed.
4. Transfer orzo to serving bowl, and toss with arugula puree. Season with salt and pepper.
