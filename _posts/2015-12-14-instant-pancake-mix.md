### Servings
3 batches

### Ingredients
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda (check expiration date first)
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar


### Directions
1. Combine all of the ingredients in a lidded container. Shake to mix.
2. Use the mix within 3 months.
3. "INSTANT" PANCAKES:
4. 2 eggs, separated
5. 2 cups buttermilk
6. 4 tablespoons melted butter
7. 2 cups "Instant" Pancake Mix, recipe above
8. 1 stick butter, for greasing the pan
9. 2 cups fresh fruit such as blueberries, if desired
10. Heat an electric griddle or frying pan to
11. 350 degrees F. Heat oven to 200 degrees F.
12. Whisk together the egg whites and the buttermilk
13. in a small bowl. In another bowl, whisk the egg
14. yolks with the melted butter.
15. Combine the buttermilk mixture with the egg yolk
16. mixture in a large mixing bowl and whisk together
17. until thoroughly combined. Pour the liquid ingredients
18. on top of the pancake mix. Using a whisk, mix the
19. batter just enough to bring it together. Don't try to
20. work all the lumps out.
21. Check to see that the griddle is hot by placing a few
22. drops of water onto to the griddle. The griddle is
23. ready if the water dances across the surface.
24. Lightly butter the griddle. Wipe off thoroughly with
25. a paper towel. (No butter should be visible.)
26. Gently ladle the pancake batter onto the griddle
27. and sprinkle on fruit if desired. When bubbles begin
28. to set around the edges of the pancake and the
29. griddle-side of the cake is golden, gently flip the
30. pancakes. Continue to cook 2 to 3 minutes or
31. until the pancake is set.
32. Serve immediately or remove to a towel-lined
33. baking sheet and cover with a towel. Hold in a
34. warm place for 20 to 30 minutes.
