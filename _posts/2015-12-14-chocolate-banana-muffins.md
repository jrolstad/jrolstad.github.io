### Servings

### Ingredients
- 2 small, very ripe bananas (about 8 oz)
- 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 c. nonfat buttermilk
- 1 c. flour
- 1/2 c. cocoa powder
- 3/4 c. sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- pinch of salt
- butter flavored nonstick spray

### Directions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray every other cup of muffin tray with cooking spray and set aside.
2. Place bananas and vanilla in food processor and process until pureed. Transfer to medium mixing bowl, whisk in eggs and buttermilk. (Do not overmix or muffins become tough.) Set aside.
3. In another medium bowl, sift together dry ingredients. Using a large spoon, stir in banana mixture until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared cups to almost the top. (By using every other cup, you allow heat to circulate more freely allowing muffins to rise better.)
4. Bake for about 35 minutes until toothpick tests done. Place on wire rack to cool. Serve warm with icing or whipped cream.
