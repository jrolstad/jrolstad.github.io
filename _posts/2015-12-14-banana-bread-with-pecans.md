### Servings
1 loaf

### Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 overripe bananas
- 1 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup pecans, finely chopped
- Confectioners' sugar, for dusting



### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and lightly
2. grease a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan.
3. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking
4. soda, and salt; set aside.
5. Mash 2 of the bananas with a fork in a small
6. bowl so they still have a bit of texture. With
7. an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk,
8. whip the remaining bananas and sugar together
9. for a good 3 minutes; you want a light and
10. fluffy banana cream. Add the melted butter,
11. eggs, and vanilla; beat well and scrape down
12. the sides of the bowl. Mix in the dry ingredients
13. just until incorporated; no need to overly blend.
14. Fold in the nuts and the mashed bananas with a
15. rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared
16. pan. Give the pan a good rap on the counter to
17. get any air bubbles out.
18. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until golden
19. brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of
20. the loaf comes out clean. Don't get nervous if the
21. banana bread develops a crack down the center
22. of the loaf; that's no mistake, it's typical. Rotate
23. the pan periodically to ensure even browning.
24. Cool the bread in the pan for 10 minutes or so,
25. and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely
26. before slicing. Toast the slices of banana bread,
27. dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve.
