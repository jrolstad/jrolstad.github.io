### Ingredients
- 1 cup orange juice
- 3 Tbsp. maple syrup
- 1 1/2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
- 1 Tbsp. grated fresh ginger (1 tsp. or so dried can do in a pinch)
- 1 1/2 lb squash (I used delicata), peeled (not necessary with delicata), seeded, halved lengthwise, and cut into 1/2 inch wide strips
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 6-8 cups mixed greens (I used organic spring mix) or whatever amount looks right
- 1/2 cup roasted salted pistachio nuts
- 3 oz goat cheese (can substitute feta if you must) :)

### Directions
1. For marinade, in a small bowl stir together orange juice, maple syrup, mustard, and ginger. Set aside 1/2 cup for salad dressing. Place squash in a large resealable bag and pour remaining marinade over squash. Seal bag and marinate, refrigerated, for 1-4 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 40 Coat a large baking sheet with thin layer of oil or nonstick cooking spray.
3. Drain squash, discarding marinade, and place on prepared baking sheet. Roast squash until tender and lightly browned in spots, 26-30 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
4. For the dressing, in a small bowl whisk together the reserved marinade, salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the oil. Drizzle 2-3 Tbsp. of dressing over the warm squash; toss to combine. In a large bowl combine the mixed greens and half the pistachios. Toss with half the dressing. Gently toss roasted squash into salad. Top with remaining pistachios and dollops or crumbles of goat cheese. Pass remaining dressing.
