### Ingredients
- 2 cups small cauliflower florets (about 1/2 inch in diameter)
-  2 tablespoons water
-  4 ounces extra-lean lower-sodium ham, chopped (3/4 cup)
-  2 teaspoons canola oil
-  1 cup chopped red sweet pepper (2 small)
-  2 cloves garlic, minced
-  8 ounces red potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
-  1 3/4 cups no-salt-added chicken broth
-  1/8-1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
-  1 12 - ounce can evaporated fat-free milk
-  1 tablespoon cornstarch
-  1/2 cup sliced green onions (4)
-  2 tablespoons light butter or diet margarine
-  1 tablespoon snipped fresh sage
-  2 ounces reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (1/2 cup)

### Directions
1. In a small microwave-safe bowl combine cauliflower and the water. Cover with vented plastic wrap. Microwave on 100 percent power (high) 3 to 5 minutes or until cauliflower is very tender. Cool slightly; drain. Place cooked cauliflower in a food processor or blender. Cover and process or blend until pureed. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan cook ham in 1 teaspoon of the hot oil over medium-high heat 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove ham; set aside.
2. In the same large saucepan cook sweet pepper and garlic in the remaining 1 teaspoon hot oil 3 minutes. Stir in potatoes, broth, and crushed red pepper. Bring to boiling over high heat; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, about 10 minutes or just until potatoes are tender.
3. In a small bowl combine evaporated milk and cornstarch, stirring until smooth. Add to saucepan; cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Stir in 1/4 cup of the green onions, the margarine, sage, ham, and pureed cauliflower. Cook over medium-low heat 5 minutes to heat through and allow flavors to blend. Serve topped with cheese and the remaining 1/4 cup green onions.
