### Servings
8

### Ingredients
- 1 cup brown rice
- Water
- Coarse salt

### Directions
1. The Right Ratio: Trust us: Though it's printed on the package, the standard 2-to-1 ratio makes mushy rice. For long-grain brown rice, use 1 1/4 cups water to 1 cup rice. For short-grain, use 1 1/2 cups water.
2. Quick Cooking Time: Bring rice, water, and coarse salt (1/4 teaspoon per cup of rice) to a boil. Cover, and reduce to a slow, steady simmer. Many recipes call for 50 minutes, but we think 30 minutes is plenty. A wide, shallow pot with a tight-fitting lid ensures evenly cooked grains.
3. Steam and Fluff: Let the cooked rice sit for 10 minutes, covered, to absorb maximum moisture; then remove the lid, and fluff the grains with a fork.
