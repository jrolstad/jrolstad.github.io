### Ingredients
- 1 Bag (11.5 oz.) Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips
- 6 Tbsp Unsalted butter
- 3 Eggs
- 1 cup Sugar
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp. baking poweder
- 1 bag (12 oz) Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
- 1 cup (4 oz) Walnuts

### Directions
1. In a double boiler over hot water, melt the bittersweet choclate chips and butter.  In a large bowl with electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar until thick; stir in chocolate mixture.  In a small bowl, stir together flour and baking powder; stir into chocolate mixture.  Gently mix in semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts.
2. Using a sheet of plastic wrap, form dough into two logs, each 2 inches in diameter and about 8 inches long.  As dough will be very soft, use plastic wrap to hold dough in log shape.  Wrap tightly.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Unwrap dough; with sharp knife, cut into 3/4-inch slices.  Place slices 1 1/2 inches apart on greased or parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until shiny crust forms on top, but interior is still soft.
4. Cool on baking sheet.  Enjoy!
