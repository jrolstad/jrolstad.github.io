### Servings
6 dozen

### Ingredients
- About 1½ cups (¾ lb.) Challenge Butter, at room temperature
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 Tablespoon grated orange peel
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 large egg
- 3¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1½ cups dried cranberries
- 1½ cups sweetened flaked dried coconut

### Directions
1. In a large bowl, with a mixer on medium speed, beat 1½ cups butter, sugar, orange peel, and vanilla until smooth. Beat in egg, until well blended.
2. In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt. Add to butter mixture, stir to mix, then beat on low speed until dough comes together, about 5 minutes (see notes). Mix in cranberries and coconut.
3. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and place about 2 inches apart on buttered 12" x 15" baking sheets.
4. Bake in a 350°F regular or convection oven until cookie edges just begin to brown, 11 to 15 minutes (shorter baking time will yield a chewier cookie; longer baking time will yield a crispier cookie). If baking two sheets at once in one oven, switch their positions halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then use a wide spatula to transfer to racks to cool completely.
5. Yield: About 6 dozen cookiesPREP AND COOK TIME: About 1 hourNOTES: The mixture may look dry until it comes together as a dough. If its too crumbly to form into balls, the dough need to be mixed longer; it should be a smooth homogeneous mass.Per cookie: 92 cal., 45% (41 cal.) from fat; 7 g protein; 5 g fat (8 g sat); 12 g carbo (4 g fiber); 58 mg sodium; 13 mg chol.Source: Recipe developed by Sunset Magazine Test Kitchens for Baking with Challenge
