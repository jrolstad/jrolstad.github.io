### Ingredients
- 2 ripe avocados
- 4 fresh eggs
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped chives

- Note:
- This recipe calls for chopped chives, but feel free to 
- serve with whatever fresh herbs or other toppings 
- you have available. A tablespoon of salsa or a little 
- hot sauce would offer a nice hit of spice.

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2. Slice the avocados in half, and take out the pit.
3. Scoop out about two tablespoons of flesh from
4. the center of the avocado, just enough so the egg
5. will fit snugly in the center.
6. Place the avocados in a small baking dish. Do your
7. best to make sure they fit tightly.
8. Crack an egg into each avocado half. Try your best
9. to crack the yolk in first, then let the egg whites spill
10. in to fill up the rest of the shell.
11. Place in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes.
12. Cooking time will depend on the size of your eggs
13. and avocados. Just make sure the egg whites have
14. enough time to set.
15. Remove from oven, then season with pepper, chives,
16. and garnish of your choice. Enjoy!
