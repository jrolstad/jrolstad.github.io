### Ingredients
-     1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
-     3/4 cup all-purpose flour
-     Roasting pan with turkey drippings
-     3/4 cup dry white wine
-     4 cups Turkey Stock
-     Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper


### Directions
1. elt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. When butter begins to bubble, whisk in flour. Cook, whisking often, until flour is cooked through and has a nutty fragrance, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove roux from heat and let cool to room temperature. Use roux immediately or transfer to an airtight container and keep refrigerated, up to 1 month.
2. Pour pan drippings into a fat separator to remove fat; set aside. Alternatively, pour pan drippings into a glass bowl and use a spoon to remove fat from top of drippings; set aside.
3. Place reserved roasting pan over 2 burners on medium heat. Pour wine into pan; using a wooden spoon, stir, scraping up bottom bits from pan. Let cook until wine is reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 2 minutes; add reserved pan drippings. Add 4 cups hot turkey stock and bring to a boil. Whisk in 4 to 5 tablespoons roux mixture and return to a boil; let simmer until gravy is thick, adding more roux if necessary. Season with salt and pepper.
