### Ingredients
-     12 ounces dried elbow macaroni (2-2/3 cups)
-     1 1/2 cups milk
-     1/4 cup butter, melted
-     1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degree F. In a large pot cook macaroni according to package directions; drain. Return to pot.
2. Add milk, melted butter, pepper, and salt. Stir in cheeses. Transfer to a greased 2-quart casserole.
