### Ingredients
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground pepper
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 3 cups grated zucchini (about one large zucchini)
- 1 cup fresh sweet corn off the cob or frozen corn
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or your favorite cheese)
- 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour

### Directions
1. In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, salt, pepper
2. and dried herbs. Whisk to combine.
3. Add the zucchini, corn and cheddar cheese and
4. stir thoroughly with a spatula.
5. Add the flour and stir until thoroughly combined
6. and there are no pockets of dry flour hiding in the batter.
7. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle to medium-high
8. heat, adding a very small amount of oil to the skillet/griddle.
9. Using an ice cream scoop, scoop 1/4-cupfuls of batter onto the
10. skillet and flatten, if necessary, with the back of the scoop into a
11. circle about 4 inches in diameter.
12. Cook on each side about 3-4
13. minutes, or until a deep golden brown. Remove from skillet and
14. transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
15. Serve warm with your favorite toppings (Iâ€™m partial to salsa and sour cream).
