### Servings
16 small or 20 Large

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 1/4 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup graham cracker crumbs
- 16 peanut butter cups, regular size
- 1 1/2 cups marshmallow fluff*

- Fluff is pretty impossible to measure, so this doesn’t have to be an exact amount, just kind of eyeball it. As long as you have enough to cover the PB cups, you’re good to go.

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line an 8×8 baking
2. dishing with parchment paper; coat lightly with cooking spray.
3. In a large bowl of the bowl of stand mixer, beat butter and
4. sugars until fluffy.  Beat in egg and vanilla until combined.
5. Scrape down the sides.  With the mixer on low, stir in the
6. flour, baking powder, salt, and graham cracker crumbs
7. until mixed.
8. Spread 2/3 of the dough on the bottom of the prepared
9. baking dish.  Lightly press the peanut butter cups into the
10. dough, then spread marshmallow fluff on top.  Press the
11. remaining dough on a non-stick surface into the shape of
12. an 8×8 square.  Place the square on top of the fluff and
13. press down lightly.
14. Bake for 30 minutes or until the edges just begin to brown.
15. Allow to cool for at least two hours* to give the bars a
16. chance to set, then remove from the pan and cut into
17. squares with a large, sharp knife.
18. *Originally I said the bars needed to cool for 8 hours,
19. but after making them again I’ve realized they’re ready
20. to go after only about  I also bet they are DAAANG
21. good straight from the oven
