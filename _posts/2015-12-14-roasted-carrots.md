### Ingredients
- 12 carrots
- 3 Tablespoons good olive oil
- 1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2 Tablespoons minced fresh dill or parsley

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. If the carrots are thick, cut them in half lengthwise; if not, leave whole.  Slice the carrots diagonally in 1 ½ inch-thick slices.  (The carrots will shrink while cooking so make the slices big.)  Toss them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, pepper.  Transfer to a sheet pan in 1 layer and roast in the oven for 20 minutes, until browned and tender.
3. Toss the carrots with the minced dill or parsley, season to taste and serve
