### Servings

### Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 small leeks, white parts only, washed well, thinly sliced crosswise
- 1 pound parsnips, peeled, roughly chopped
- 1 pound Idaho potatoes, peeled, roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup milk
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper

 

### Directions
1. In a large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add leeks, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add parsnips, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes more. Add potatoes and 3 cups cold water; bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Cook until parsnips and potatoes are very tender and begin to fall apart, about 20 minutes.
2. Drain in a colander. Press hot parsnips and potatoes through a ricer back into saucepan over low heat. (Alternatively, mash by hand.) Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the milk, and combine well. Season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
