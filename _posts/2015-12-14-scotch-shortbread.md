### Servings


### Ingredients
- 1/2 pound butter
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3/4 pound flour (2 1/2 to 2 3/4 cups flour)

### Directions
1. Put sugar on breadboard; put butter on top of sugar and let it soften (but not melted - only soft enough to work in)
2. Knead butter and sugar together; then gradually knead in flour.  It should be a firm ball, may take up to 3 cups of flour
3. Flatten out with your hand in an 11x7 pan; take knife or spatula and even out all over (must be smooth and same thickness all over)
4. Take a fork and jab hard to bottom of pan all over, with a maximum of 1/2 inch distant between holes
5. Bake in a moderate oven at 325 degrees for 1 hour; in my oven, it only takes 20-30 minutes so start watching after about 15 minutes.  If golden brown, take out of oven and put to ear - should you hear any noise it has not yet finished baking, so put it back in oven and keep a close eye as it can burn quickly.
6. Cut in desired sizes and let it cool; place in a tin and keep separate from other cookies; tastes much better after 3-4 days.
