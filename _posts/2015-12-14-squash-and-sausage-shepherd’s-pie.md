### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425 F.   Lightly coat six to eight 10 to 12 oz. individual casseroles with nonstick cooking spray.
2. In a 6-quart Dutch oven cook squash in lightly salted boiling water, covered, for 15 to 17 minutes or until tender when pierced witha fork.  Drain; return to Dutch oven.  Mash with butter, Parmesan, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper; set aside.
3. In a large skillet cook sausage over medium-high heat, breaking up with the back of a wooden spoon until no longer pink.  Transfer meat to a colander; drain well.  Wipe out skillet with a paper towel.
4. In same skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add garlic; cook 2 minutes more.  Stir in broth, crushed tomatoes, rosemary, and Worcestershire sauce.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in meat, peas and carrots, remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper; cook 2 minutes.  Divide mixture among prepared dishes.  Spread top with butternut squash.  Place on a large baking sheet.
5. Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes or until top is lightly browned.  Top with shaved Parmesan and green onion, if desired.  Makes 6-8 servings.
