### Ingredients
- Mix together thoroughly: 
- 1/2 cup soft shortening (part butter)
- 1/2 cup sugar 
- 1 egg 
- 1 tsp. vanilla 

- Sift together and stir in: 
- 1 1/8 cups sifted GOLD MEDAL Flour 
- 1/4 tsp. soda 
- 1/2 tsp. salt

### Directions
1. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet.
2. Bake 6 - 8 minutes (recipe says 8-10 minutes) until delicately browned (cookies should still be soft). Cool slightly then remove from baking sheet.
3. VARIATION: Chocolate Chip – replace 1/2 cup sugar with White & Brown sugar to equal 3/4 cup; 1/2 cup nuts, chopped; 1-7oz. bag chocolate chips.
4. Grandma used the Nestle Toll House Cookie Recipe on the back of the bag she would double the dough and used only ONE bag of chips. She used the Toll House cookie dough for Gum Drop cookies too – cutting the Gum Drops in pieces.
