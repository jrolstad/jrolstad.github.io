### Servings
4

### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 shallot, peeled and minced
- 1 pound white button mushrooms, finely chopped
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1 cup finely chopped parsley
- 2 whole boneless chicken breasts, split




### Directions
1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add garlic and shallot; saute, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the mushrooms; cook, stirring, until mushrooms release their juices, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add white wine, and continue cooking until liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in the parsley.
2. Pull skin back from one chicken breast, keeping skin attached at one end. Season with salt and pepper. Mound 1/3 cup mushroom filling on breast; pull skin back over filling. Tuck ends under breast, forming a ball. Secure with toothpicks. Repeat with remaining chicken and filling.
3. Place stuffed breasts in a roasting pan, keeping them close together but not touching. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over top. Transfer to oven; roast until skin is golden brown and chicken has cooked through, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven, and serve.
