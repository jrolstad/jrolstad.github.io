### Servings
24 tots

### Ingredients
- 2½ cups raw cauliflower florets (about 2 cups when cooked)
- 1 large egg (*see note below)
- 1 large egg white
- ½ cup onion, diced
- 1 tsp garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, minced
- ½ cup Colby Jack cheese, grated
- ½ cup seasoned Panko breadcrumbs
- salt and pepper, to taste

### Directions
1. First, cook the cauliflower florets by pouring ¼ inch of water
2. into a large pan over medium heat. Once the water is simmering,
3. reduce the heat to low and add the cauliflower. Cover with a lid
4. and let simmer for about 5 minutes. The cauliflower should be
5. tender, but not mushy when done.
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
7. Chop the cauliflower into fine pieces and place 2 cups of the
8. cauliflower pieces into a medium bowl. Add the remaining
9. ingredients and stir.
10. Shape about 1½ tablespoon of cauliflower mix into an
11. egg-shape and place on a prepared baking sheet. Be
12. careful not to overcrowd the baking sheet.
13. Bake for 25 minutes, flipping the tots occasionally to
14. brown each side.
15. Serve immediately.
16. NOTES
17. *These cauliflower tots will firm up in the oven. If you
18. are unable to shape the tots at all, then you may add
19. an extra egg. Just keep in mind that the nutritional
20. value will change slightly.
