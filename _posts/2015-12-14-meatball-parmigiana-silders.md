### Ingredients
- MEATBALLS
- 2 slices white or sandwich bread, torn into 1-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 8 ounces ground beef (85 percent lean)
- 8 ounces ground pork
- 4 ounces ground veal
- 1/2 cup finely grated pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese (1 ounce)
- 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 large egg
- Coarse salt
- Marinara Sauce
- SANDWICHES
- 2 dozen brioche rolls, split
- 1 1/2 cups coarsely grated mozzarella cheese (5 ounces)
- 1/2 cup finely grated pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese (1 ounce)
- Small basil leaves



### Directions
1. Make the meatballs: Soak bread in milk for 5 minutes. Gently mix bread and milk with meats, pecorino Romano, parsley, garlic, egg, and 1 teaspoon salt. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Roll mixture into twenty-four 1-ounce balls (each about the size of a golf ball).
3. Heat sauce in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Drop meatballs into sauce, and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook, partially covered, until meatballs are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Make the sandwiches: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Working in batches, arrange rolls, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Place 1 meatball, a spoonful of sauce, 1 tablespoon mozzarella, and 1 teaspoon pecorino Romano on bottom halves. Bake until cheese melts, about 3 minutes. Sandwich with basil.
5. Helpful Hint
6. Simmered meatballs can be refrigerated in sauce for up to 3 days. Reheat meatballs in sauce, and assemble sandwiches just before serving.
