### Ingredients
- 16 large frozen french-fried waffle cut potato (1/3 of 22 oz pkg)
- 1 lb ground beef or turkey
- 2 to 3 tsp. grilling seasoning blend
- 4 slices cheddar cheese, cut in quarter (4 oz)
- 4 cherry tomatoes, sliced
- Mustard, Ketchup, pickels and/or sour cream

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with foil.  Evenly space potatoes on baking sheet.  Bake potatoes for 18 tgo 20 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned.  Remove from the oven.  Adjust oven racks and preheat broiler.
2. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine meat and seasoning.  Form into sixteen 1 oz mini burgers (about 2 Tbsp).  In a 12 inch skillet cook burgers, uncovered, over medium high heat for 5 minutes or until temperature registers 160 degrees F on an instant thermometer, turning burgers once halfway through cooking.  Drain fat.  Top each potato waffle with a burger, cheese quarter, and tomato slice.  Broil for about 4 to 5 inches from the heat for 1 to 2 minutes or until cheese is melted and tomato begins to brown.  Serve with mustard, ketchup, sour cream or pickles.
