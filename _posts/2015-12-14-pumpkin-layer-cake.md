### Ingredients
- 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pans and parchment
- 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for parchment
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- Salt
- 2 cups packed light-brown sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups solid-pack pumpkin (from one 14 1/2-ounce can)
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 3/4 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger
- 1/2 cup low-fat buttermilk

- Goat Cheese Frosting
- Quince-Ginger Compote




### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush two 8-inch round cake pans with butter; line with circles of parchment, and brush with butter. Dust with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
2. Beat butter and sugar with a mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Beat in pumpkin; add vanilla and ginger. Reduce speed to low. Add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with butter milk, and beginning and ending with flour. Scrape down side of bowl as needed. Divide batter between pans.
3. Bake cakes until golden brown, pulling away from sides of pans, and until a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool in pans set on wire racks for 15 minutes. Invert cakes onto racks. Let cool.
4. Evenly spread half the goat cheese frosting on top of 1 cake. Top with the second cake, and frost top with the remaining frosting. Top cake with some quince-ginger compote, and serve remainder on the side.
5. Helpful Hint
6. Make Ahead: Unfrosted cakes can be stored, wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for up to 2 days.
