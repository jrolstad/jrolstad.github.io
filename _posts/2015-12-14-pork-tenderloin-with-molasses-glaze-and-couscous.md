### Servings
4

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup unsulfured molasses
- Juice and zest of 2 lemons
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 cup boiling water
- 1 cup couscous
- 2 pork tenderloins (8 ounces each), trimmed
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped
- Olive-oil cooking spray




### Directions
1. In a small bowl, combine molasses, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and ginger; set aside. In a medium heat-proof bowl, pour boiling water over couscous; cover, and let sit.
2. Rub pork with salt and pepper. Heat grill to medium high. Spray both grill and pork with cooking spray. Sear pork 2 to 3 minutes on all sides. Brush on molasses glaze. Cook, covered, turning and glazing when needed until an instant-read thermometer registers 150 degrees when inserted into the middle, about 12 minutes more. Let the pork rest 10 minutes before slicing.
3. To serve, fluff couscous with a fork. Toss with parsley, lemon zest, and meat juices. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle serrano vinaigrette over pork and couscous; garnish with minced serrano pepper.
