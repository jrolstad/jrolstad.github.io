### Servings
4 Cups

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2 pints fresh blueberries
- 2 containers (6 ounces each) fresh blackberries
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch

### Directions
1. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, stir together sugar, lemon juice, and half the blueberries and blackberries. Bring just to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until blueberries burst and release juices, about 3 minutes.
2. In a small bowl, dissolve cornstarch in 1 teaspoon cold water. Stir into sauce. Simmer, stirring, about 1 minute more, until sauce thickens slightly. Remove pan from heat; stir in remaining berries. Transfer sauce to a serving bowl. Chill until cold; stir before serving with pie.
