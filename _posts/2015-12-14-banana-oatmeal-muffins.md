### Servings
12

### Ingredients
- 2 /1/2 cup oats (old fashioned kind, not quick cooking)
- 1 single serving cup (or 1 cup) of plain low fat greek yogurt
- 2 eggs
- 3/4 cup sweetener of choice, I used the real stuff: sugar! or 2 tbs stevia sweetener
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 bananas (I only used one but realized it needed at least one more)

- Important: The paper liners don't work well when baking with a base that does not include flour, they always seem to stick to the paper. I sprayed the muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray or you can use foil cupcake liners or a silicone muffin pan.

- Variations:
-   Orange rind, OJ, dried cranberries, nut of choice, cardamon
-   grated apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, nuts
-   shredded coconut, dried mango, little dried ginger, pineapple
-   1 cup can pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, pinch cloves (kids like a little bit of mini chocolate chips
-   Lemon rind, lemon juice, poppy seeds and blueberries

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray tin with non-stick cooking spray or line 12 muffin tins with silicone or foil liners, (or just use a silicone muffin pan).
2. Place all of the ingredients, including bananas in a blender or food processor, and blend until oats are smooth.
3. * Important: I add the oats a cup at a time and then add the liquids. I have to stop the blender and stir a few times throughout as well.
4. **(Bethany direction:  I grind the oatmeal in a food processor into a chunky flour consistency then dump in a bowl and add all the ingredients like a typical muffin recipe.)
5. Divide batter among cupcake liners, and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.
