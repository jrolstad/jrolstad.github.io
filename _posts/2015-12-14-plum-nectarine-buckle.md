-     1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
-     1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
-     1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
-     Salt
-     1 large egg
-     2/3 cup whole milk
-     1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
-     3/4 pound plums, halved, pitted, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges (2 cups)
-     3/4 pound nectarines, halved, pitted, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges (2 cups)
-     1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
    
- Crumble Topping
-      6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
-     1/4 cup packed light-brown sugar
-     1/4 teaspoon finely grated orange zest, for Rhubarb-Berry Crumbles (optional)
-     1 cup all-purpose flour
-     Pinch of salt

- Directions

- Put butter and brown sugar, and orange zest if desired, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until creamy. Stir in flour and salt. Work mixture through fingers until it forms coarse crumbs ranging in size from peas to gum balls.




### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush a 9-inch square cake pan or 10-inch cast iron skillet with 2 tablespoons butter; set aside. Whisk together flour, 3/4 cup sugar, the baking powder, allspice, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl; set aside.
2. Whisk together egg, milk, vanilla, and remaining 4 tablespoons butter in another medium bowl. Add egg mixture to flour mixture; stir to combine. Spread batter evenly into buttered pan.
3. Toss plums, nectarines, lemon juice, remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Spread fruit mixture evenly over batter. Sprinkle with topping. Bake until a cake tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack 1 hour before serving.
