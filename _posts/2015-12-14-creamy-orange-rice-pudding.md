### Ingredients
- 1 orange
- 1 1/4 cups Arborio rice
- 4 cups milk
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1/2 vanilla bean, split, seeds scraped
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

### Directions
1. Remove zest from orange using the smallest holes on a box grater, and set aside. Cut ends off orange, and remove peel, pith, and outer membranes, following the curve of the fruit with a paring knife. Lift sections away from membranes, and set aside. Squeeze juice from membranes over sections before discarding.
2. Place the Arborio rice, milk, reserved orange zest, lemon zest, vanilla bean and seeds, salt, and sugar in a medium saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender and most but not all of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream. Remove the vanilla bean, and serve the pudding in small bowls garnished with orange sections.
