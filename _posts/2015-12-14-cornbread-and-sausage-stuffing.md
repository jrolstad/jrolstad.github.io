### Ingredients
-     1 pound fresh pork sausage, casings removed, crumbled (plus giblets, diced; optional)
-     1 large onion, (about 2 cups), finely chopped
-     3 celery, finely chopped (1 1/2 cups)
-     Coarse salt and ground pepper
-     2 pounds prepared cornbread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes (12 cups)
-     3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage
-     3 large eggs, lightly beaten
-     1 to 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth


### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large nonstick skillet, cook sausage (and giblets, if using) over medium-high heat, stirring often, until browned and cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl.
2. To pan, add onion, celery, and 1/4 cup water. Reduce heat to medium; cook, scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon, until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Add to sausage.
3. Add cornbread, sage, and eggs to sausage and vegetables. Bring broth to a simmer in a small saucepan; pour 1/2 cup over stuffing, and toss gently (cornbread will break down into smaller pieces). If needed, add up to 1/2 cup more broth, until stuffing feels moist, but not wet. Stuff into turkey, using about 4 cups. Spoon remaining stuffing into a baking pan; it should reach the top. Refrigerate stuffing in pan and remaining broth separately, covered, until ready to bake.
