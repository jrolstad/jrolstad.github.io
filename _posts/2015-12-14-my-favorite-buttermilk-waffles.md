### Ingredients
- 1 and 3/4 cups (210g) all-purpose flour
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs, separated
- 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- 1/3 cup (67g) granulated sugar
- 1 and 3/4 cups buttermilk1
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- butter + pure maple syrup for topping

### Directions
1. Preheat waffle maker on medium-high heat. Preheat oven to 200F degrees. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet; set aside.
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder,
3. baking soda, and salt.
4. Set aside. In another large bowl, whisk the egg yolks,
5. butter, sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla together until combined.
6. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk
7. gently until smooth. Do not overmix.
8. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks
9. form. I typically use a handheld or stand mixer fitted with
10. a whisk attachment to whisk the egg whites. Using a rubber
11. spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the batter.
12. Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into each well of the waffle maker
13. (or less if your waffle maker is smaller) and close the lid. Cook
14. the waffles util golden brown and crisp, 5-6 minutes. Transfer
15. the cooked waffles to the wire rack and keep warm in the
16. preheated oven as you cook the rest. Repeat to cook the
17. remaining batter.
18. Serve the waffles immediately with butter and maple syrup,
19. or your choice of toppings.
20. Make ahead tip: Waffles are best enjoyed the same day.
21. Extras may be refrigerated up to 3 days. Waffles may be
22. frozen, up to 3 months, then warmed in the toaster.
