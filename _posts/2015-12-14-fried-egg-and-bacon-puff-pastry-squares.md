3. out into a 12-inch square. Prick pastry all over with a fork.
4. Cut into thirds to yield three 4-inch-wide strips, then cut
5. strips crosswise into thirds (you should have nine 4-inch squares).
6. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, and freeze until
7. firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees with r

10. Lightly beat 1 egg with water. Brush top of pastry squares
11. with egg wash; place 2 pieces (1 slice) bacon on each square.
12. Bake until pastry is puffed and golden brown and bacon is
13. cooked through and crisp around edges, 15 to 18 minutes.
14. STEP 3
15. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over
16. medium-high heat. Crack 3 eggs into skillet, and cook until
17. whites are set and golden brown along edges but yolks are
18. still runny, about 4 minutes. Place 1 egg on top of each of
19. 3 pastry squares, and season with salt and pepper. Transfer
20. to a serving platter, and loosely cover with foil. In 2 more
