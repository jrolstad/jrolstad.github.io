### Ingredients

- 2 packages Red Star Quick Rise Yeast
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tbsp orange zest
- 1 cup water
- 2/3 cup milk
- 2/3 cup vegetable oil
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2/3 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 1/2 cups craisins

- Orange Glaze (combine until smooth)
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/8 tsp vanilla
- 1/2 tsp orange zest
- 2 to 3 tsp orange juice

### Directions
1. In large mixer bowl, combine 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and zest
2. Heat water, milk, and oil to 120-130 degrees fahrenheit.
3. Add flour mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened
4. Add eggs, beat 3 minutes at medium speed.
5. By hand, stir in whole wheat flour, walnuts, craisins and enough remaining flour to make a firm dough
6. Knead on floured surface 5 to 7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.  Use additional flour if necessary.
7. Place dough in lightly oiled bowl and turn to grease top.
8. Cover.  Let rise in warm place until light and almost doubled, about 25-30 minutes
9. Punch down dough.  Divide into 2 parts.
10. 1 On a lightly floured surface, roll or pat each into 14" x 7" rectangle.
11. 1 Starting with shorter side, roll up tightly, pressing dough into roll.  Pinch edges and ends to seal.
12. 1 Place in greased 9" x 5" loaf pans.
13. 1 Cover.  Let rise until indentation remains after lightly touching the side of loaf.
14. 1 Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes until golden brown.
15. 1 Remove from pans, cool.
16. 1 When bread is cool, drizzle with Orange Glaze
17. You can substitute Instant (fast-rising) yeast for Active Dry Yeast. Traditional methods- replace 1: Expect your dough to rise faster; always let your dough rise until ‘ripe’. Bread Machines- use ½ tsp Instant yeast (or ¾ tsp Active Dry yeast) per cup of flour in your recipe
