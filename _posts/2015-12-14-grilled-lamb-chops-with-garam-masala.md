### Servings

### Ingredients
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 2 teaspoons coarse salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- 4 lamb shoulder chops (each 6 to 7 ounces and 3/4 inches thick)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- Cilantro sprigs, for garnish

- Garam masala is an Indian spice blend available in specialty stores and some supermarkets. To make your own, mix together 1/2 teaspoon each of ground pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cumin, and coriander, along with a generous pinch of cloves.



### Directions
1. Heat grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. In a bowl, combine garam masala, salt, and pepper. Place lamb chops on a baking sheet or platter, and drizzle with oil; rub chops to coat evenly all over. Sprinkle tops of chops with half the spice mixture, and gently rub onto meat. Turn chops over; repeat with remaining spice mixture.
2. Grill chops until they reach desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro
