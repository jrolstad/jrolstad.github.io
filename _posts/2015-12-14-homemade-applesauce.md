### Servings
12

### Ingredients
- 10 to 12 Braeburn, Cortland, or McIntosh apples (about 5 1/2 pounds), cored and cut into eighths 
- 1 cup water 
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
- 2 cinnamon sticks 
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
- Pinch salt 
- 2 tablespoons sugar, or more, to taste

### Directions
1. In a large saucepan or stockpot, combine all the ingredients, except the sugar. Cook over high heat until the apples begin to release their liquid, about 5 minutes.
2. Cover and reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the apples soften and begin to break apart, about 1 hour, stirring frequently.
3. Reduce the heat to low and partially cover. Cook until the apples fall apart and the mixture reaches sauce consistency, about 30 minutes.
4. Remove from the heat. Add the sugar (if needed) and stir well.
5. Put the mixture through a food mill or a fine mesh strainer, pushing with the back of a spoon to extract as much sauce as possible.
6. Discard the cinnamon sticks and apple skins.
