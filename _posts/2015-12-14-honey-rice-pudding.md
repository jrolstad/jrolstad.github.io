### Ingredients
- 3 3/4 cups whole milk
- 1/2 cup short-grain rice, such as Arborio
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- 3 tablespoons honey, plus more for drizzling

### Directions
1. Bring 3 1/2 cups milk, the rice, sugar, vanilla, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often, until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
2. Remove from heat. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup milk and the honey. Let stand for 5 minutes. Divide among parfait glasses or bowls, and drizzle with honey.
