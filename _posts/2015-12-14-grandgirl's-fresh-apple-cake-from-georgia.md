### Ingredients
- Cake:
- Butter, for greasing pan
- 2 cups sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup orange juice
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups peeled and finely chopped apples
- 1 cup shredded coconut
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- Sauce:
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda


### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Generously grease a tube pan.
2. For the cake: in a large bowl, combine the sugar, eggs, oil, orange juice, flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and vanilla extract; and mix well. Fold apples, coconut, and pecans into batter.
3. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a tester comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours.
4. Shortly before the cake is done, make the sauce: Melt the butter in a large saucepan, stir in the sugar, buttermilk, and baking soda, and bring to a good rolling boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Pour the sauce over the hot cake in the pan as soon as you remove it from the oven. Let stand 1 hour, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.
