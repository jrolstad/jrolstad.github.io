### Ingredients
- 20 Pitted dates

- 1 tbsp of nut butter (In my case I used 
- macadamia and almond butter but any 
- nut butter would work)

- 1/3 cup of crushed pistachios

### Directions
1. Place all the pitted dates in the blender along with the
2. nut butter and blend for about 2 minutes or until you
3. get a smooth consistency.
4. After that start forming the ball shapes, if things are
5. getting sticky you can add some oil to your hands.
6. Once formed roll them in the crushed pistachios
7. Place in the freezer for about 20 minutes. If you have the
8. will power not to eat all of those on the spot they can be
9. saved in the fridge for later
10. You can also roll them in desiccated coconut. Same recipe
11. just sub the pistachios with the desiccated coconut
