### Servings
12

### Ingredients
- 12 eggs (organic, free range)

- A little coconut oil, olive oil or grass-fed butter to line the muffin tins with
- Sea salt + pepper to taste

- Vegetables — I made the following 3 kinds:
- Tomato + basil (1/4 cup chopped tomatoes, 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil)
- Kale + garlic (1/2 cup chopped kale, 3 cloves chopped garlic)
- Cilantro + green onion (1/4 cup chopped cilantro, 1/4 cup green onion)

### Directions
1. Pre-heat oven to 35 Lightly grease muffin tins with coconut oil,
2. olive oil or grass-fed butter.
3. Chop veggies.
4. Whisk eggs well in a large bowl, add sea salt + pepper.
5. Stir in veggies. (If you’re making different flavors, you’ll
6. need to ration the eggs into different bowls for each flavor).
7. Pour into muffin tins.
8. Bake for 20-25 mins, or until eggs are fully cooked through.
9. My recommendation: Since these are just eggs and veggies,
10. I personally like to add a little something else on top after they’re
11. cooked – like sliced avocado, hot sauce, maybe a little goat cheese.
12. So try out different variations and see what you like.
