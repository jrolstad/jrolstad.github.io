### Ingredients

-     4 pounds top round lamb
-     2 tablespoons minced garlic (4 to 5 cloves)
-     2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary leaves
-     4 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves
-     1/2 cup mild olive oil
-     1/2 cup dry red wine
-     4 tablespoons red wine vinegar
-     Kosher salt
-     4 small red onions
-     4 pints cherry tomatoes
-     Wooden skewers

- For the sauce:

-     1 cup good chicken stock
-     1/2 cup good olive oil
-     2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
-     1/4 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary leaves
-     1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
-     1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper


### Directions
1. Cut the lamb in 1 1/2-inch cubes. You should have about 40 cubes. Combine the
2. garlic, rosemary, thyme, olive oil, red wine, vinegar, and 1 teaspoon of salt in a
3. medium bowl. Add the lamb cubes, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate
4. overnight or for up to 2 days. Toss occasionally.
5. Heat a charcoal grill with coals. Spread the coals in 1 tight layer on the grill.
6. Cut the red onions in quarters and separate each quarter into 3 or 4 sections.
7. Loosely thread 3 or 4 pieces of lamb alternately with sections of onion on
8. skewers. Sprinkle both sides of the lamb with salt and pepper. Next place
9. 4 or 5 cherry tomatoes on skewers, threading them through the stem of
10. the tomato. Rub the tomatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and
11. pepper. First, place the lamb skewers on the hot grill and cook for 10 to 15
12. minutes, turning 2 or 3 times, until the lamb is medium rare. Approximately
13. 5 minutes before the lamb is done, place the tomato skewers on the grill,
14. turning once, until seared on the outside but still firm inside.
15. For the sauce, bring the chicken stock, olive oil, and lemon juice to a boil in
16. a medium pot. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, until reduced in half.
17. Add the rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and the pepper. Serve the sauce on the side.
