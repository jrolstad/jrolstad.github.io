### Ingredients
- 4 red bell peppers (roasted, peeled, and seeded)
- 2 cloves garlic
- ¾ cup walnuts
- ½ cup bread crumbs
- ½ cup parsley
- 4 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 Tablespoons pomegranate molasses
- 4 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 1½ teaspoons red pepper flakes or ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- black pepper, to taste

### Directions
1. Place the peppers on a parchment-lined baking sheet and
2. drizzle lightly with some oil. Put the tray into a hot oven
3. (450°F) or under the broiler until the peppers' skins blister
4. and darken. When the peppers are roasted, remove from
5. the oven, place them into a bowl, and cover it for 10 minutes.
6. After 10 minutes the skins will have loosened. Remove the
7. skins and all of the seeds--you only want the flesh of the peppers.
8. Put the roasted peppers into a food processor with the garlic
9. and purée until smooth.
10. Add the rest of the ingredients to the food processor and
11. blend just until smooth.
12. Taste the muhammara for seasoning and serve with a
13. drizzle of olive oil on top.
14. NOTES
15. -You can use jarred roasted peppers. Just rinse the brine
16. off of them and proceed with the recipe.
17. -Make it as spicy as you want by adding more cayenne
18. pepper or leave it out entirely for a mild muhammara.
