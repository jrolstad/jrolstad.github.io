### Directions
1. Brine:
2. To make the brining solution, dissolve the salt and sugar in 2
3. gallons of cold water in a non-reactive container (such as a
4. clean bucket or large stockpot, or a clean, heavy-duty, plastic
5. garbage bag.) Add the oranges, lemons, thyme, and rosemary.
6. Note: if you have a big turkey and need more brine than this,
7. use 1/2 cup salt and 1/2 cup brown sugar for every gallon of water.
8. Preparation of the Turkey:
9. Remove the neck, giblets, and liver from the cavity of the turkey
10. and reserve for the gravy. Rinse the turkey inside and out under
11. cold running water.
12. Soak the turkey in the brine, covered and refrigerated, for at l
13. east 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
14. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
15. Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse well under cold
16. running water. Pat dry with paper towels, inside and out. Place
17. breast side down in a large, heavy roasting pan, and rub on all
18. sides with the butter. Season lightly inside and out with salt and
19. pepper. Stuff the turkey with the onion, orange, celery, carrot,
20. bay leaves, and thyme. Loosely tie the drumsticks together with
21. kitchen string.
22. For the turkey broth: Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over
23. medium high heat. Add the turkey neck, heart, and gizzard to the
24. pan and saute until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add
25. the chopped vegetables and bay leaf to the pan and saute until soft,
26. about 2 minutes. Pour the stock and 3 cups of water into the pan and
27. bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the
28. stock is reduced to 4 cups, about 1 hour, adding the chopped liver to
29. the pan during the last 15 minutes of cooking.
30. Strain the stock into a clean pot or large measuring cup. Pull the meat
31. off the neck, chop the neck meat and giblets, and set aside.
32. Roast the turkey, uncovered, breast side down for 1 hour. Remove
33. from the oven, turn, and baste with 1/2 cup stock. Continue roasting
34. with the breast side up until an instant-read meat thermometer
35. registers 165 degrees F when inserted into the largest section of
36. thigh (avoiding the bone), about 2 3/4 to 3 hours total cooking time.
37. Baste the turkey once every hour with 1/2 to 3/4 cup chicken or turkey stock.
38. Remove from the oven and place on a platter. Tent with aluminum
39. foil and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.
40. For the pan gravy: Pour the reserved turkey pan juices into a glass-measuring
41. cup and skim off the fat. Place the roasting pan on 2 stovetop burners
42. over medium heat add the pan juice and 1 cup turkey broth and the
43. white wine to the pan, and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape any brown
44. bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining 3 cup of broth and
45. bring to a simmer, then transfer to a measuring cup.
46. In a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium high heat.
47. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, to make a light roux. Add
48. the hot stock, whisking constantly, then simmer until thickened, about
49. 10 minutes. Add the reserved neck meat and giblets to the pan and
50. adjust seasoning, to taste, with salt and black pepper. Pour into a gravy
51. boat and serve.
