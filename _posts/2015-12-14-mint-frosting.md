### Servings


### Ingredients
- Mint frosting:
- ½ c. butter softened  (3/4 c.)
- 2 Tbsp. milk  (3 Tbsp.)
- 2 c. powdered sugar  (3 c.)
- 1 tsp. peppermint extract  ( 1 ½ tsp.)
- green food coloring

- Chocolate Ganache Topping:
- ½ c. butter  (3/4 c.)
- 1 ½ c. good semi sweet chocolate chips  (2 ¼ c.)

### Directions
1. Frosting:
2. Mix thoroughly.  Evenly frost brownies and put back in freezer for 20 minutes. Make chocolate ganache top layer.
3. Ganache:
4. Melt and whisk together.  (I melt them together in a Pyrex measuring bowl in the microwave for one minute.  Be careful not to overheat.  It won’t look melted but once whisked it is.)  Drizzle warm chocolate over brownies and spread smooth with a spatula.  Put back in freezer for another 20 minutes.
