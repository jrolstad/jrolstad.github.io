### Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup packed light-brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups semi-sweet and/or milk chocolate chips (12 ounces)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with the both sugars;  beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.  Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs.  Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined.  Stir in chocolate chips.
2. Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
3. Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8-10 minutes.  Remove from the oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.  Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.
