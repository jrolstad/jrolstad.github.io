### Servings

### Ingredients
- 2 (.25 ounces) packages active dry yeast
- 1 ¾ cup warm water (110 degrees F)
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup butter, melted and cooled
- 1 egg beaten
- 2 ¼ cups whole wheat flour
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour

- ¼ cup butter, melted

### Directions
1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.   Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Mix sugar, salt, ¼ cup melted butter, egg and whole wheat flour into yeast mixture.  Stir in all purpose flour, ½ cup at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.  Turn dough out onto a well floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.  Lightly oil a large bowl, place dough in a bowl and turn to coat.  Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down dough, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled again, about 30 minutes.
4. Grease about 2 dozen muffin cups.  Punch down dough, and divide into two equal portions.  Roll each into a 6x14 inch rectangle and cut rectangles into twelve 7x1 inch strips.  Roll strips up into spirals, and place into muffin cups.  Brush tops with melted butter.  Let rise uncovered in a warm place for 40 minutes or until dough has doubled in bulk.
5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from the oven, and brush with melted butter.
6. Note:
7. If you would like to freeze the rolls, bake for 8 minutes, remove from the oven, allow to cool, bag and freeze.  Then when ready to use, thaw and finish the baking process.
