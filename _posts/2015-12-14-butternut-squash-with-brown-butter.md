### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 butternut squash (about 1 3/4 pounds), peeled, seeded, and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
- 1/2 cup low-sodium canned chicken broth
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tablespoon dark brown-sugar




### Directions
1. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown. Add squash; saute, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and tender when pierced with a fork, about 16 minutes.
2. Add chicken broth, the water, and brown sugar; cook until liquid has evaporated and squash is nicely caramelized, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper. Serve.
