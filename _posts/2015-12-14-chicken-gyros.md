### Servings
4

### Ingredients
- For serving:

- 4 pitas or flatbreads, warmed for 20 seconds in the microwave between damp paper towels
- Diced tomatoes
- Diced red onion
- Dried parsley

- For the chicken:

- 2 teaspoons garlic, minced (about 4 cloves)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 heaping tablespoons non-fat greek yogurt (I recommend Fage)
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- A few shakes of salt and pepper
- 4 boneless, skinless, chicken breast halves

- tzatziki sauce:

- 16 ounces non-fat Greek yogurt
- 1 cucumber, peeled, diced, and very finely diced
- 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons minced garlic (3-4 cloves)
- 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
- Salt, pepper, and fresh lemon juice to taste

### Directions
1. Combine all of the above ingredients except for the chicken in a dish, and whisk together to make a marinade. Add in chicken, and turn to coat. Cover, and place in the fridge for 1 hour to marinate.
2. Using a thick stack of paper towels, squeeze the diced cucumbers to remove as much water as possible. Repeat if necessary. In a medium bowl, combine cucumbers with all of the above ingredients. Cover, and place in the fridge.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
4. After the chicken is done marinating, place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until it is cooked thoroughly and juices run clear. 99% of the time that I make chicken I use these. They are relatively small, cook evenly, and are done in 20 minutes flat. The ginormous breasts (heheh) that I often see at the store might need even longer. Make sure they're cooked to 165 degrees to be safe. (Can you tell I'm kind of neurotic about cooking chicken?)
5. After your chicken is thoroughly cooked, allow it to rest for a few minutes, and then slice it into strips.
6. Assemble gyros with chicken, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, onions, and dried parsley, wrap in foil for ease of eating, and enjoy!
