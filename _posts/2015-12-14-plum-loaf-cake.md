### Servings
10

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 3/4 cup Splenda (my attempt to feel better about eating even more cake this week - feel free to sub sugar)
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp almond extract
- zest of one small lime
- 1 tsp ground cardamom
- 1 pint very ripe cherry-sized plums, pitted and separated into small pieces (skins on)
- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2/3 cup vanilla yogurt (full or lowfat)
- 2/3 cup Skor toffee bits
- coarse turbinado or other raw sugar

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a large loaf pan (preferably nonstick).
2. Cream together butter, sugar and splenda. Add eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each one. Add extracts, zest and cardamom and stir to blend. Add in plums. Don't be worried if they get mashed to a pulp when you blend them in. Sift together remaining dry ingredients. Add 1/3 dry ingredients, then 1/3 cup yogurt, then the second third of dry ingredient, the rest of the yogurt, and finally add in toffee and remaining dry ingredients. Mix until just combined (don't overmix!) The batter should be just a little on the dry side of a normal cake batter.
3. Pour batter into the loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake for about 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack.
