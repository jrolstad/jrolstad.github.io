### Ingredients
- 12 ounce Belgian-style wheat beer
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 14 ounce package smoked sausage, such as kielbasa, cut in 3 inch pieces
- 2-3 cups fresh green beans
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 medium cooking apples, cored and thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoon packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon finely shredded orange peel
- 8 small sage leaves (optional)

### Directions
1. In a large saucepan combine 1/2 of the beer and the crushed red pepper; bring to a boil.  Add sausage and green beans.  Return to a simmer; cook, covered, 5-8 minutes or until beans are tender.  Drain and set pan aside.
2. In another skillet melt 1 tablespoon butter; add apples.  Cook, turning occasionally  until apples are just tender.  Transfer apples to plate or serving platter.
3. Add sausage to the same skillet (leave green beans in other pan).  Cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides.  Add to plate with apples and cover. Drain fat from skillet if needed.
4. In the empty skillet carefully add remaining beer (mixture may foam a bit); stir to scrape up browned bits.  Add remaining tablespoon of butter, brown sugar, cider vinegar, and orange peel.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and boil gently, uncovered, 5 to 6 minutes or until slightly thickened.  Return sausage and green beans to skillet to coat with glaze.  Heat through.  Fold in apples.
5. Place all in a serving tray/dish.  Sprinkle with sage (if desired) and serve.
