### Ingredients
- 1 whole chicken (4 1/2 to 5 pounds), quartered, backbone removed
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 8 large scallions (or 10 to 12 small)
- 1/2 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Brush chicken on both sides with oil, and season generously with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 40 minutes.
2. Add scallions to sheet. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of the chicken's thigh registers 165 degrees and scallions are just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a platter; reserve baking sheet. Let chicken stand for 10 minutes before carving.
3. Set baking sheet on 2 burners over medium heat. Slowly add wine, and cook, scraping brown bits with a wooden spoon, until bubbling. Pour sauce into a bowl; skim excess fat. Serve chicken and scallions with sauce.
