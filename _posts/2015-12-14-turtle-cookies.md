### Ingredients
- 1 c. all-purpose flour
- 1/3 c. cocoa powder
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 8 T. (1 stick) butter, softened
- 2/3 c. sugar
- campaignIcon Shop
- 1 large egg, separated, plus 1 additional egg white
- 2 T. milk
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 c. pecans, finely chopped

- Caramel Filling:
- 14 soft caramel candies (I used Kraft Traditional Caramels)
- 3 T. heavy cream

- Chocolate Drizzle (optional):
- 2 oz. semi-sweet chocolate (I used 2 squares of Baker's semi-sweet chocolate)
- campaignIcon Recipes
- 1 tsp. shortening


### Directions
1. Combine flour, cocoa, and salt; set aside.
2. With electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter
3. and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg
4. yolk, milk, and vanilla; mix until incorporated. Reduce
5. speed to low and add flour mixture until just combined.
6. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
7. firm, 1 hour.
8. Whisk egg whites in a bowl until frothy.  Place
9. chopped pecans in another bowl.  Roll chilled dough
10. into 1-inch balls, dip in egg whites, and then roll in
11. pecans.  Place balls about 2 inches apart on a baking
12. sheet. Using a 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon, make
13. an indentation in the center of each dough ball.
14. Bake at 350 degrees until set, about 12 minutes.
15. Prepare the Caramel Filling:
16. Microwave caramels and cream together in a small bowl,
17. stirring occasionally, until smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes.
18. Once cookies are removed from the oven, gently
19. re-press the indentations.  Fill each indentation with
20. about 1/2 teaspoon of the caramel mixture. Cool on
21. the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to
22. cool completely.
23. Prepare the Chocolate Drizzle (optional):
24. Place chocolate and shortening in a small zip-top
25. plastic bag.  Set bag in a bowl of warm water to soften.
26. Gently knead the chocolate with your fingers until melted
27. and smooth, placing back in the warm water for a minute
28. or two as needed.
29. Snip a very small hole in the corner of the plastic bag.
30. Drizzle chocolate over the cooled Turtle Cookies.
