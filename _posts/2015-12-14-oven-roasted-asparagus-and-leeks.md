### Ingredients
- 6 medium leeks
- 20 thick asparagus spears (about 1 pound)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Freshly ground pepper to taste
- Balsamic vinegar (optional)




### Directions
1. Trim each leek at the root end, making sure the stalk stays intact, then cut off the top where the green part begins. Cut leeks in half lengthwise. Immerse in a bowl of cold water to loosen any sand or grit. Rinse under cold running water, and pat dry.
2. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Trim tough ends from asparagus. In a large bowl, combine asparagus and leeks. Drizzle olive oil over vegetables, and toss to coat. Add salt, and season with pepper; toss to combine.
3. Place vegetables in a heavy roasting pan, and transfer to oven. Roast until vegetables start to turn brown and are fork tender, about 25 minutes. Remove pan from oven, and set on heat-proof surface until vegetables are cool enough to eat. When ready to serve, drizzle with balsamic vinegar, if desired.
