### Ingredients

-     3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp (170 g plus 30 g) of white sugar
-     10 fresh plums (we use Santa Rosa), sliced and seeded - about 4 cups
-     2 Tbsp corn starch
-     1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-     1 cup (110 g) all purpose flour
-     1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
-     1/4 teaspoon salt
-     1/4 cup (50 g) butter
-     1/4 cup (60 mL) milk
-     1 egg, lightly beaten

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large bowl, combine 3/4 cup white sugar, plums, cornstarch and cinnamon. Place the fruit mixture in a 2-quart casserole.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 2 Tablespoons of sugar, flour, baking powder and salt. Cut the butter in with a fork or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and egg until just moistened.

5. Serve with whipped cream (optional).
