### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups  fine ground blanched almond flour 
-                   (scoop and sweep method not packed)
- 1/2 tsp baking soda.
- 1/4 tsp  salt
- 1/2 tsp   cinnamon(optional) 
- 3 large  eggs (or equivalent weight pastured eggs)
- 4-5 Tbls full fat coconut milk or as needed for consistency.
- 2 Tbls  honey
- 1 tsp vanilla or juice of half a lemon
- 1/4 cup fruit (optional)
- Oil for frying 


### Directions
1. Instructions:
2. In a medium bowl, sift and/or mix together
3. the almond flour, baking soda salt and optional spice.
4. In a separate bowl, blend together the eggs,
5. coconut milk  honey and vanilla.
6. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry and
7. mix well. Let rest for a few
8. minutes.
9. PrePre-heat your pan over medium heat(I use cast iron).
10. Watch the heat closely, it likes to climb. If it gets too hot,
11. not only will the pancakes burn, they will be badly shaped
12. and hard to flip. This will vary depending on your stove top
13. and pan. I like to use cast iron. A metal pan may need a
14. lower heat. There should be some "sizzle" when the batter
15. hits the pan.
16. Add batter to pan.  If you have trouble flipping the pancakes,
17. try making them silver dollar sized.
18. Fry the pancake till it starts to bubble and the edges just start
19. to form(and dry a bit). If they start cooking too quickly
20. (burning before it's time to flip) then adjust the heat.
21. Every stove top is different. Flip over carefully using a
22. THIN METAL spatula. Continue to cook till the pancake
23. puffs and firms up.
24. Makes about 25-30 silver dollar size pancakes
25. If needed, keep pancakes in a warm oven. The pancakes
26. freeze and reheat well. I like to make them ahead of time,
27. freeze them then put them in the toaster to reheat.
28. Top with honey, maple syrup or your favorite natural
29. sweetener and or cold coconut cream.
