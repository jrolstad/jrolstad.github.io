### Ingredients
- 9 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups cake flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups unsweetened shredded desiccated coconut (available at Whole Food Market)
- 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk

### Directions
1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat 8 tablespoons butter and the sugar on medium speed until fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla, and beat until fluffy.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, and salt. Add flour mixture to butter mixture, and beat on low speed until combined. Add coconut, and beat until combined. Roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment paper into a 7- to 8-inch-by-15 1/2 - inch rectangle, a very scant 1/4 inch thick. Using a sharp knife, trim to form neat rectangle. Transfer dough to a baking sheet, and place in refrigerator to chill at least 1 hour.
3. Place the chocolate and the remaining tablespoon butter in the top of a double boiler or a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water.  Melt completely, about 2 minutes, and remove from heat.  Stir in the condensed milk.  Let sit until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Peel off the top piece of parchment. Using an offset spatula, spread the melted chocolate mixture over the dough. Using the bottom piece of parchment for support, roll the dough into a log. Wrap the log in parchment, and chill overnight.
5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Remove the parchment from the log, and cut log into 1/4-inch rounds. Place the rounds on a parchment covered cookie sheet and bake until light golden brown on edges, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating half way through. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool. Store the cookies in an airtight container up to two weeks. Makes about 3 dozen.
