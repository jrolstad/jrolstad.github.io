### Servings
8

### Ingredients
- 2¼ tsp. instant yeast
- 1 tbsp. honey
- 1¼ cups warm water (105˚-115˚ F), divided
- 1½ cups bread flour, divided
- 1½ cups whole wheat flour, divided
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp. salt
- Cornmeal, for sprinkling

### Directions
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer*, combine the yeast,
2. honey and ½ cup of the water.  Stir gently to blend.
3. Whisk ¼ cup of the bread flour and ¼ cup of the
4. whole wheat flour into the yeast mixture until smooth.
5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside until
6. doubled in bulk and bubbly, about 45 minutes.
7. Remove the plastic wrap and return the bowl to the
8. mixer stand, fitted with the dough hook.  Add in the
9. remaining ¾ cup of warm water, 1¼ cups bread flour,
10. 1¼ cups whole wheat flour, olive oil and salt.  Knead
11. on low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic,
12. about 8 minutes.  Transfer the ball of dough to a lightly
13. oiled bowl, turning once to coat, and let rise in a warm
14. draft-free place, about 1 hour, until doubled in bulk.
15. Place an oven rack in the middle position.  Place a baking
16. stone in the oven (if using) and preheat to 500˚ F.
17. Once the dough has risen, transfer to a lightly floured
18. work surface, punch down the dough and divide into 8
19. equal pieces.  Form each piece into a ball.  Flatten one
20. ball at a time into a disk, then stretch out into a 6½-7 inch
21. circle.  Transfer the rounds to a baking sheet or other work
22. surface lightly sprinkled with cornmeal.  Once all the rounds
23. have been shaped, loosely cover with clean kitchen towels.
24. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, until slightly puffy.
25. Transfer 4 pitas, 1 at a time, onto the baking surface.
26. (Note: These can be baked on a baking stone or directly on
27. the oven racks.  I use a pizza stone, but either method is fine.)
28. Bake 2 minutes, until puffed and pale golden.  Gently flip the
29. pitas over using tongs and bake 1 minute more.  Transfer to a
30. cooling rack and let cool completely.  Repeat with the remaining
31. pitas.  Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
32. *As always, anything mixed in a stand mixer can be mixed by hand.
