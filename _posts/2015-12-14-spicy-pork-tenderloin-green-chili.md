### Ingredients
- 8 ounces fresh Anaheim chile peppers (3 to 4 peppers)
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, trimmed of fat and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
- 3 cups chopped onions (3 large)
- 3 tablespoons bottled minced garlic
- 1 pound fresh tomatillos, peeled and diced (about 4 cups)
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano, crushed
- 3 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup water
- 1 15 ounce can no-salt-added navy beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 2 tablespoons snipped fresh cilantro

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange chile peppers on a baking sheet. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes or until skins are dark, turning once halfway through roasting. Place chile peppers in a bowl; cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 10 minutes. Carefully remove skins and seeds; chop chile peppers.* Set aside.
2. In a 5- to 6-quart Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook until brown. Add onions and garlic; cook about 5 minutes more or just until onions are tender, stirring occasionally. Add tomatillos, cumin, and oregano; cook for 3 minutes more, stirring occasionally.
3. Stir in broth and the water. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in beans, lime juice, and chopped chile peppers. Simmer for 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with cilantro. Makes 6 servings (1-1/2 cups each)
